We hang out in <code>#robustirc</code> on RobustIRC (<a href="/">instructions for connecting to RobustIRC</a>).

In addition, there are also two email mailing lists:
<ol>
<li>
<a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robustirc-announce">robustirc-announce</a>,
where announcements about the project in general and about new releases in
particular will be posted. Expected traffic is on average 1 email per week
tops.<br>
If you are running a RobustIRC network, you should be subscribed to this list.
