<h3>RobustIRC v0.5 (2017-03-30)</h3>

<i class="fab fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
RobustIRC v0.5 contains the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We switched to version 2 of <code>sorcix/irc</code>, which allows us to correctly interpret trailing and non-trailing IRC message parameters. This fixes issues with one-word messages in IRC clients such as Quassel, but might expose bugs in other programs/libraries. See <a href="https://github.com/breunigs/frank/commit/eb5f7dd3afe71ba9c40d3d0606c9af1073055b08">this bugfix in an IRC bot</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>ISON</code> IRC command has been implemented.</li>
<li>The <code>PING</code> IRC command is now ignored for idle time in <code>WHOIS</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>INVITE</code> IRC command is now invalidated on <code>JOIN</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>WHOIS</code> IRC command now results in <code>RPL_WHOISREGNICK</code> for identified users.</li>
<li>The <code>TOPIC</code> IRC command now properly checks for operator status in <code>+t</code> channels.</li>
<li>The user mode <code>+i</code> (invisible) has been implemented, dropping <code>PRIVMSG</code> and <code>NOTICE</code> IRC commands targetting you unless the sender shares a common channel with you.</li>
<li>The irclog debug handler is now significantly faster (2m17s to 9s) due to using a bulk iterator.</li>
<li>The configuration revision is now actually applied, protecting against conflicting edits.</li>
<li>All mutex locks have been audited for correctness and a test has been added.</li>
<li>TLS certificates/keys are now reloaded upon receiving a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal.</li>
<li>When creating a channel, its modes now default to <code>+nt</code>.</li>
<li>RobustIRC bridges can now be marked as trusted, resulting in the forwarded IP address being exposed. See <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/issues/122">issue #122</a> for details.</li>
<li>The IRC channel mode <code>+x</code> has been implemented, requiring the user to solve a captcha before joining the channel.</li>
<li>The <code>CaptchaRequiredForLogin</code> configuration option has been implemented, requiring users to solve a captcha before logging into the IRC network.</li>
<li>The <code>MaxSessions</code> and <code>MaxChannels</code> configuration options have been implemented for limiting the maximum amount of memory.</li>
<li>The GetMessage and session tables on the status pages are now sortable.</li>
<li>The status pages now feature a quick way to kill sessions. Multiple sessions can be selected by holding the shift key.</li>
<li>The status pages have been split into multiple subpages.</li>
<li>At most one GetMessages request is now allowed per session per node.</li>
</ul>

<h3>RobustIRC v0.4 (2016-08-16)</h3>

<p class="links">
<i class="fab fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/releases/tag/v0.4">GitHub tag</a>
<i class="fab fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
RobustIRC v0.4 contains the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Compaction is now replaced by snapshotting. See <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/commit/2d3a623d02d40059a100dee58a190d7ed60c4815">commit 2d3a623d02d40059a100dee58a190d7ed60c4815</a> for details. This removes the dependency on SQLite and a bunch of code/SQL statements, finally addressing the issue that RobustIRC instances would grow indefinitely over time.</li>
<li>contrib: the prometheus monitoring configuration has been updated to be compatible with more recent versions of prometheus.</li>
<li>compaction_test now works on OS X (previously ran into the NOFILES limit).</li>
<li>Snapshot restore performance was improved by avoiding to print a message to stderr for each message that is applied. On single-core machines this greatly improves performance by avoiding context switches to Docker which intercepts all messages that go to stderr.</li>
<li><code>robustirc-localnet</code> now generates a new certificate when the existing certificate will expire soon.</li>
<li>travis: fix travis configuration (use go1.6, fix go vet invocation)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The known weakness of v0.1 to v0.3 with regards to compaction not covering all
message types yet is finally addressed — compaction now works by snapshotting
state instead of identifying and deleting obsolete messages.
</p>

<h3>RobustIRC v0.3 (2016-02-20)</h3>

<p class="links">
<i class="fab fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/releases/tag/v0.3">GitHub tag</a>
<i class="fab fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
RobustIRC v0.3 contains the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Two messages of death have been fixed: <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/commit/531dbc140a38e84afd0fa282244c0317bbd35772">commit 531dbc1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/commit/979b014ff1806fcb31dfa3c861793f23c5208dae">commit 979b014</a></li>
<li>Nodes are prevented from joining the network when their clock drift is too high</li>
<li><code>robustirc-removepeer</code> (new) safely removes nodes from a network</li>
<li>Compaction now is much more efficient: completes within 10 seconds, uses &gt;1GB less RAM</li>
<li>Faster start by recreating the irclog database instead of deleting all entries (5 minutes → 40 seconds)</li>
<li>Less RAM usage by moving outputstream from RAM to a temporary LevelDB (&gt; 100MB less RAM)</li>
<li>jepsen now includes a RobustIRC test, successfully verifies network partition handling</li>
<li>To prevent mistakes, -singlenode and -join are now disabled when the node already has data</li>
<li>Log files are now kept below 250MB correctly even when running in Docker</li>
<li>Channel mode +n (no external messages) is now implemented</li>
<li>Malformed NICK messages (trailer instead of first parameter) are now accepted (for <a href="http://www.quassel-irc.org/">Quassel</a>)</li>
<li>Capitalization-only nick changes are now supported</li>
<li><code>robustirc-dump</code> (new) dumps the contents of irclog, raftlog and snapshots</li>
<li><code>robustirc-canary</code> (new) compares how two versions of RobustIRC process the same input</li>
<li><code>robustirc-localnet</code> now generates certificates that also work with Chrome ≥ 49.0.2618.8</li>
</ul>

<p>
The known weakness of v0.1 and v0.2 with regards to compaction not covering all
message types yet is still not entirely addressed.
</p>

<h3>RobustIRC v0.2 (2015-05-22)</h3>

<p class="links">

<i class="fab fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
RobustIRC v0.2 contains the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>(a number of small bugfixes, see git changelog)</li>
<li>Important bugfixes for <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/issues/100">issue #100 (deadlock)</a></li>
<li>Important bugfixes for <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/issues/115">issue #115 (timeout handling)</a></li>
<li>GetMessages will be aborted when nodes are partitioned, minimizing network unavailability</li>
<li>GetMessages resuming was fixed for messages with more than one reply</li>
<li>PostMessage limit was increased to cope with pathological cases with regards to JSON encoding</li>
<li>Compaction was made significantly faster (O(hours) → O(minutes))</li>
<li>IRC message routing was refactored, the previous approach did not work for all messages</li>
<li>SVSJOIN, SVSPART and SVSHOLD were implemented for NickServ’s AJOIN and RECOVER commands</li>
<li>KNOCK and NAMES were implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>
The known weakness of v0.1 with regards to compaction not covering all message
types yet is still not entirely addressed (but slightly better already).
</p>


<h3>RobustIRC v0.1 (2015-03-12)</h3>

<p class="links">
<i class="fab fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/releases/tag/v0.1">GitHub tag</a>
<i class="fab fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
This is the first public release of RobustIRC. It has been used for a number of
weeks with (by now) more than 30 users. That said, since it is the first
release, there are probably a couple of rough edges.
</p>

<p>
A known weakness of this version is compaction not being completely implemented
for all IRC commands: if you let this version of RobustIRC run for too long, it
will eventually run out of memory/disk. We are talking about many weeks
here, but it’s important to be aware of it. When using this version, we
strongly recommend you upgrade to newer versions soon.
