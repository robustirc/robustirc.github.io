<h3>RobustIRC v0.2 (2015-05-22)</h3>

<p>
<i class="fa fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/releases/tag/v0.2">GitHub tag</a>
<i class="fa fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
RobustIRC v0.2 contains the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>(a number of small bugfixes, see git changelog)</li>
<li>Important bugfixes for <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/issues/100">issue #100 (deadlock)</a></li>
<li>Important bugfixes for <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/issues/115">issue #115 (timeout handling)</a></li>
<li>GetMessages will be aborted when nodes are partitioned, minimizing network unavailability</li>
<li>GetMessages resuming was fixed for messages with more than one reply</li>
<li>PostMessage limit was increased to cope with pathological cases with regards to JSON encoding</li>
<li>Compaction was made significantly faster (O(hours) → O(minutes))</li>
<li>IRC message routing was refactored, the previous approach did not work for all messages</li>
<li>SVSJOIN, SVSPART and SVSHOLD were implemented for NickServ’s AJOIN and RECOVER commands</li>
<li>KNOCK and NAMES were implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>
The known weakness of v0.1 with regards to compaction not covering all message
types yet is still not entirely addressed (but slightly better already).
</p>


<h3>RobustIRC v0.1 (2015-03-12)</h3>

<p>
<i class="fa fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/releases/tag/v0.1">GitHub tag</a>
<i class="fa fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
This is the first public release of RobustIRC. It has been used for a number of
weeks with (by now) more than 30 users. That said, since it is the first
release, there are probably a couple of rough edges.
</p>

<p>
A known weakness of this version is compaction not being completely implemented
for all IRC commands: if you let this version of RobustIRC run for too long, it
will eventually run out of memory/disk. We are talking about many weeks
here, but it’s important to be aware of it. When using this version, we
strongly recommend you upgrade to newer versions soon.
